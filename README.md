# Profitable App Profiles for Google Play Markets

This project aims to perform a quick evaluation of what factors could affect the total number of installs for an app. Here we assume that the total number of installs can directly determain if one app is profitable since 1) if the app is not free, more download means higher profit and 2) even if the app is free more installs brings more user which mean any adds within the app have a higher exposure to the public and more people wolud subscribe to whatever services the app offers.

This project applies random forest regressor and tries to:

- Predict how many times an app is installed
- Observe what are the most important feature(s) affecting # installed



Besides, simple data exploration is performed for reference..
